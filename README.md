# Project Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with 7 Stocks

This project uses deep learning techniques to predict the next-day closing price of selected stocks by applying a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The data is sourced from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) for each stock. 

## Objective
Build LSTM models that learn from historical stock data to forecast future closing prices, focusing on time-series prediction.

- **AAPL**, **AMZN**, **GOOGL**: Trained on data from 2022-01-01 to 2025-05-01.
- **META**, **MSFT**, **NVDA**, **TSLA**: Trained on data from 2020-01-01 to 2025-05-01.

## Note
- **Yahoo Finance Web Scraping** have limited requests, if fetching data too frequently.
